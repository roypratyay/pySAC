# pySAC
This script processes seismic event data from a CSV file using the obspy library and FDSN web services. Users can filter events by date and magnitude, select a specific event, and retrieve waveform data for a specified seismic phase at a given station. The retrieved waveform data is then saved in SAC (Seismic Analysis Code) format.
